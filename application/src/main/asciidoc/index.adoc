= Blang Board API

A Ubiquitous Language Board.

*Ubiquitous Language* is the term Eric Evans uses in _Domain Driven Design_ for the practice of building up a common, rigorous language between developers and users.

It is not uncommon for multiple Teams to share the Terms across their respective contexts, but supply their own Definitions for those Terms.

It is also not uncommon for similar Terms to be used differently for certain audiences. The Business Users and Technical team may share the Term _Database_, for example, but it has a very different meaning to each of these groups.
